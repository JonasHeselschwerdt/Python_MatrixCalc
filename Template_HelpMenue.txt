### How to use the matrix calculator ###

1. Getting started

Make sure Matrix_Calculator.py, Output_File.txt, Template.txt and Template_HelpMenue are in the same folder!
If you accidentaly deleted any of the files you can download them from Github: https://github.com/JonasHeselschwerdt/Python_MatrixCalc
If you have made sure they exist and are in the same folder you can start Matrix_Calculator.py and open
Output_File.txt (we recommend VSCode for that). For the best experience open both Matrix_Calculator.py and Output_File.txt
in Split-Screen-view.

2. Typing in Matrices

Now you can start typing in your matrices, they can have as many digits / decimal places as you want,
however the autoscaling only works from -9999 up to 9999. When you are done don't forget to save! (Tip: Double clicking a 
Matrix Index like "a11" will allow you to quickly overwrite it)

3. Performing Calculations

After starting the program the console will have asked you about your desired first operand.
You can type "A","B","C" or "Ans". After pressing enter you will be asked about the operator you want to
use, here you can choose between "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, "t" to transpose
or "i" for inverting. Now press enter. If you chose "+", "-" or "*" you will now need to type in the second operand
(exactly like before). Press enter. Now you can type in the Matrix where the solution will be stored in, by default Ans will
be used for that. If you chose "i" or "t" as operator there is no need to type in a second operand, you will just be 
asked where you want to store the solution. Now press enter to start the calculation.

4. Repeat

Now Output_File.txt will change automatically, it will display you the performed calculation, where
the solution has been saved, and all the new matrices, as well as their determinants.
The console of Matrix_Calculator.py will now ask you again about your first operand. You can now make changes 
to your matrices and continue doing calculations or keep doing calculations without any changes to your matrices.
